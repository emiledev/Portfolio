    <h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
    <p>My Raspberry Pi project was setting up what is called a "Pihole" for my home network. As per <a href="https://blacklab.net/pi-hole-what-is-it/" target="_blank">blacklab.net:</a>
    Pi-hole is network-based ad-blocking software, and a custom DNS server for Raspberry Pi devices running Raspbian. It blocks ads from being displayed on the devices on your network.
    It uses DNS sinkholing and blocklists as a way of stopping internet ads, malware, malvertising, etc. It’s similar to the popular browser extensions Adblock Plus
    and uBlock Origin, however it does it for all your devices on your network. It can block YouTube ads and some in-app advertisements on mobile devices... <br>...
    Unlike browser extensions, Pi-hole blocks ads for every device connected to it. You have full control of what lists you subscribe to and untimely block. There’s
    usually no need to do any additional configuration on the device itself. For example, you could buy a new tablet and, as soon as it is connected to your wifi, it
    will immediately stop displaying ads in the web browser and most apps. Pi-hole stops ads before they are downloaded, so your network will perform better.</p>

      <h3>Wix Site</h3>
      <p>This Wix site showcases a great example of me working with a platform that offers "drag and drop" templates to build HTLML5 websites. For this
      one in particular I wanted to focus on E-commerce and make it a functional shop. Top Man Clothing is not a real company (however, it could be a
      clients!) and is not strapped to recieve/process orders. Using Wix gave me a great understanding of these types of platforms and I gained some
      valueable knowldege and experience in creating a site like this from start to finish.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="projects3-col">
      <h3>Photography Site</h3>
      <p>My photography site was inspired by wanting to showcase my photos in a more professional manner and wanting the experience of working with a
      template/style/based platform. I created this site using Adobe Portfolio and attaching Google Analytics to monitor traffic and other KPI's. This
      project showcases my creativity, versatility, and competency to learning new things.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="projects4-col">
        <h3>Coding A Book</h3>
        <p>This is where it all started for me. I was interested in learning how to code and I figured, what better way to learn than to pick up a book. Being
        a hands-on learner I wanted a way to apply what I was learning in real-time, that way I could tinker around and see the changes and progress
        that I was making. I decided that I would code essentially every single page, using the books examples but my own twist into it here and there. Doing
        this project was an essential part in me having the knowledge that I do today. Not only was this an educational project but one that I enjoyed and
        that helped deepen my passion for the world of CS and tech in general.</p>
