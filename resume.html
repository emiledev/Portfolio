    <h2>About My Work Experience</h2>
    <p>As you can see from my previous work experience I have gained a vast amount of knowledge in different fields and departments of work. While the
    skills that I have gained have been nothing short of transferable and helpful, you may be asking what applies to us?. Well, my customer service is
    exceptional, I treat others with respect, kindness, empathy, and have the ability to interact via email, phone, video chat, or even text in a professional
    manner. Understanding the customer/client is key to working together in the future, whether it be design ideas, changes they want implemented, or concerns
    they may have regarding the product/service.<br> <br>
    While customer service is a great skill to have, work ethic, attention to detail, organizational skills, and project management are all just as crucial
    to have. My work ethic is strong, while I believe in a healthy work-life balance I also believe in giving your all to the task at hand to meet deadlines
    with exceptional results. To ensure that I can provide such results, attention to detail is a key part in this and a skill in which I believe is needed
    in the type of role that I am searching for. Lastly organizational skills and project management go hand-in-hand making sure that processes run smoothly
    and efficiently. By utilizing these skills I am able to keep myself cool, calm and collected while juggling numerous tasks and deadlines as well as people.
    <br><br>
    So, what am I like as an employee? how do I function? what are my likes and dislikes? I am a self-starting and motivated individual. I work well within
    teams and usually prefer to do my work alone. If I have a question I will ask, I do not typically ask right away as I like to try and figure things out
    for myself first. Being micromanaged is not a preference of mine and need little supervision to do my tasks on a daily basis. I have years of remote work
    experience as well as within an office setting although I do prefer remote work. I like when teams can come together and share knwoledge with each other
    and can answer quesions confidently and accurately. Transparency within a work-place is important to me as I am a very honest person. I dislike run-arounds
    and excuses, rather I would like to find a solution. On a lighter note, one of my favorite snacks is a good ol' rice krispies treat and I do not like cabbage.</p>
