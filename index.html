<h1>My Portfolio</h1>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Let's get personal.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="aboutmehome-col">
    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
    <p>My name is Emile Cayer and I am a SNHU (Southern New Hampshire University) student majoring in computer science. So far I have been self taught,
    learning everything that I can to get a leg-up in the world of CS. I have focused on HTML5, CSS, and Javascript but have also dove into the world of
    networking. Linux, IOT, and Powershell have been some of my areas of focus for personal study which you will see a project for.</p>

    <div class="aboutmehome-col">
      <h3>My Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
      <p>I'd say that I am a pretty easy going guy, I am well organized, have great attention to detail and lots of ambition and drive. I am passionate
        about subjects that interest me and put my best foot forward towards efforts in whatever I do. I am coachable, resourceful and a
        quick learner. My areas of opportunity include; spending too much time on minor details sometimes, rambling when I talk, and not filling the
        Brita back up often enough.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="aboutmehome-col">
        <h3>My Goals</h3>
        <p>Short term goals: I will be graduating with my Associates degree in Computer Science in the next year to year and a half and may continue my education into
         a Bachelors degree. Learning more HTML, CSS, JS and other coding languages and frameworks. Long term goals: I would love the opportunity to work as a full
         stack developer when I have gained enough knowledge and experience. I also plan to create a homelab and learn more about home networking and cybersecurity

          <p>A true pleasure to have on the team. Emile is one of the most ambitous, helpful, and dedicated individuals that I have had the opportunity
          to work with. An outspoken leader who is not afraid to ask the hard questions and get his hands dirty whether it be on a team or during solo projects.
          Emile's work ethic is strong and he exemplifies what a driven employee is, both within his work and his interactions. 4/5 stars because he is no longer
          with our team!</p>

          <p>Emile always has a positive attitude and faces new challenges head on! He is my tech support guy who fixes everything that I can not.
          From taking on additional projects to giving you his little free time, Emile is dependable and always there to help or have a quick chat.
          Having him on the committee for our all employee team meeting, he was an impressive asset who aided in our success.4.5/5 stars because no
          one is perfect and to tease Emile!</p>
